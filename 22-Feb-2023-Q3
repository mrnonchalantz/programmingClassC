3. Write a program that calls a/few function(s) 
to determine the smaller of two arguments. 
Test the program using integer, character and floating-point number arguments. 
Produce 3 separate programs solving the problem above. 
The three approaches you should be using are:

a) 3 different functions (findMinimum1(), findMinimum2(), findMinimum3()), 
each to solve different data types parameters.

b) Function overloading with only one function named findMinimum( )

c) Function template with only one function named findMinimum( )

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int findMinimum1(int a, int b) {
    return (a < b ? a : b);
}

char findMinimum2(char a, char b) {
    return (a < b ? a : b);
}

float findMinimum3(float a, float b) {
    return (a < b ? a : b);
}

int main() {
    int int1 = 5, int2 = 3;
    char char1 = 'b', char2 = 'a';
    float float1 = 2.5, float2 = 1.2;
    cout << "Minimum of " << int1 << " and " << int2 << " is " << findMinimum1(int1, int2) << endl;
    cout << "Minimum of " << char1 << " and " << char2 << " is " << findMinimum2(char1, char2) << endl;
    cout << "Minimum of " << float1 << " and " << float2 << " is " << findMinimum3(float1, float2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
