/*
Problem 1
Write a program that consists of the following new structure;

Structure Name: Student
Content of the structure: student ID, student name, nickname

The program should ask the user to enter the details. 

The program should be able to store maximum 5 students’ data at a time. 
Finally, the program will display the details entered by the user correctly.

[Hint: array]




Problem 2
Based on Problem 1, write a program that consists of the following new structure;

Structure Name: Course
Content of the structure: course code, course name, lecturer name

The program should ask the user to enter the details of each of the course. 
The program should be able to store maximum 2 courses’ data at a time. 
Finally, the program will display the details entered by the user correctly. 

[Hint: array]
