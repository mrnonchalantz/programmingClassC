Exercise 1

A C++ program to calculate mobile phone bills. 
A call is charged at 30 cents per minute. 
The cost of line rental is RM39.90 per month, and the tax for the overall bill is 6%. 
Calculate the total amount the user needs to pay to the Telco based on the number of minutes the user uses his or her mobile phone for calls each month. 
Creatively do the input/output format of the program. 
Do provide an option for the user to continue using the program.
